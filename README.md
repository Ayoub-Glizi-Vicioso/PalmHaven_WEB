## Description of the Project

The Hotel Reservation System is designed to help hotels manage their reservations more efficiently. Prior to the development of this system, many hotels relied on traditional methods such as phone reservations and paper records, leading to difficulties in managing bookings and availability. This system offers a streamlined solution for handling bookings, cancellations, and modifications, all through a single web platform.

## Features

- **Search for Hotels:** Find available hotels based on destination and dates.
- **View Details:** See detailed information about each hotel.
- **Make Reservations:** Book rooms directly through the interface.
- **Manage Reservations:** Modify or cancel existing bookings.

## Constraints

- **Time:** The project must be completed within the given timeframe while balancing other course requirements.
- **Resources:** Utilizes the XAMPP environment for local development.
- **Security:** Ensures the protection of user data through secure practices.

## Security

- **Data Protection:** Uses encryption for sensitive information.
- **Security Measures:** Prevents common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).


## Troubleshooting

- **Page Not Found:** Ensure that your project folder is correctly placed in the `htdocs` directory and that the local server (Apache) is running.
- **Database Connection Issues:** Verify your database credentials and ensure that the database and tables are correctly set up.
